1,Gentle Giant,1970,Time 711,"Gentle Giant burst onto the scene with an astonishingly well-developed and innovative album comparable to very little else on the scene at the time (aside from perhaps some parts of King Crimson). The incorporation of medieval-inspired harmonies add a novel twist to the music, and the band's command of mood is masterful - Funny Ways, for instance, changes from a quiet folk ballad with trumpet flourishes into a jazzy workout at the drop of a pin.",1,1,1,,cover-gentle_giant.jpg,1,2017-06-03 14:04:04.334626
2,Acquiring the Taste,1971,TPT 257,"GG's debut has always been my favorite but it's admittedly not very representative of their sound. This second album is where the classic GG sound truly begins and it is arguably the best album in this style. The complexity doesn't seem like a gimmick yet and is paired with remarkable beauty rare to complex prog. 'Black Cat', 'Edge of Twilight' and 'The Moon Is Down' are particularly lovely.",1,1,1,,cover-acquiring.jpg,0,2017-06-04 08:25:38.824411
3,Three Friends,1972,TPT 271,"Smooth progressive rock with a really good funky groove to it. Great tight playing, and actually a very nice sound world is used on this album. Mellow, melodic easy to listen to. Great melodies and harmonies with also some complex structures in the music (the groovy bass lines are one good example). The organ is a really good addition to guitar and bass, and all three of them get their moments on the album, even going on in very playful takes with each others. Jamming feeling in some of the tracks!",1,1,1,,,0,2017-06-03 14:04:04.334626
4,Octopus,1972,TPT 281,"An album truly worth revisiting again and again, Octopus showcases the sheer diversity available to the band, as well as showing that they can rock out and get wild with the best of them. In particular, had the band returned to the approach of A Cry For Everyone as part of their response to the punk explosion, as opposed to turning their sound to the mainstream, I suspect they'd have both kept their original audience and attracted a surprising number of younger fans, much like Peter Hammill was able to. But enough for mourning the paths not taken - this particular album is gold from beginning to end.",1,1,1,,cover-octopus.jpg,0,2017-06-04 08:56:44.471887
